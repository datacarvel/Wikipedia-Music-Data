# Wikipedia-Music-Data
How I used SparQL to query Wikidata, scraped Wikipedia articles' infoboxes with R, and visualised the whole thing with network analysis packages like networkD3, threejs, GGally, igraph and visNetwork. In the end, the goal was to offer a new map of the evolution of music genres, based on the crowdsourced data that is Wikipedia. See html files for some results.

This is what was web scraped below:
